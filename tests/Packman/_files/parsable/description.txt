We have noted a trend towards Halflings appearing in our land attempting to destroy our Ring Of Power. This intolerable invasion by little people with hairy feet will not be allowed to continue.

As a bonus, it will dispatch a cohort of Orcs to the location of any detection. False positives are ignored. Who cares if a few expendable Orcs get eaten by giant spiders? I don't. I'm a Dark Lord, dammit!
